// Multiplication of matrices is non-commutative which means A*B â‰  B*A
// Multiplication of matrices is associative which means A*(B*C) = (A*B)*C
// For computing A*B, the number of columns in A must be equal to number of rows in B
// Existence of A*B does not imply existence of B*A
// The complexity of multiplication operation (A*B) is O(m*n*p) where m*n and n*p are order of A and B respectively
// The order of matrix C computed as A*B is m*p where m*n and n*p are order of A and B respectively
